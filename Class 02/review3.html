    <p>This is a website about the constellations in quebec. The different cities are displayed on the homepage in 3D and the number of constellations in each are shown at the bottom. After you select one area, the diagram of the city is displayed in 3D <br> with the constellations hovering above. You are able to explore each constellation and learn about story behind each one.  </p>
    <p>This website is a great way to learn about the constellations and stories behind them in a very fun and interactive way. I also really love the colour scheme of the website. Everything is in a purple hue which gives it a very magical feeling. <br>The font also goes really well with the magical feel. I love how the cities are modeled in a simple 3D blocking style and the illustrations shown for the constellations make it feel like its a children's book. </p>
