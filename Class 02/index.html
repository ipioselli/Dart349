    </h2>


    <p>This is a french website by Bien Fond√© that makes you reflect on your hopes and desires in 2022.
    It prompts you to select answers to certain questions about yourself. For instance, it asks you questions such as what do you think is the most important <br> element for creating art. It also asks you what is your biggest desire and what you would like to have in 2022.
    After you answer all the questions it reveals all your answers with a beautiful display of flowers in the background that you can save for yourself. </p>
    <p>I really love the simplicity of the design in this website. There is not too much going on so it is not distracting at all. I also really love the colours and the interactivity. When you hover over the buttons for the answers the flowers grow into the page which I find is <br> really beautiful.The soundtrack also goes really well with the content and gives more personality to the website. Overall it is a really beautiful and simple website.</p>
