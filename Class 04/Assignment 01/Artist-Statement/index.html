        <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
        <p>My final website is a parody of existing fast fashion websites.I will be exploring fast fashion and the effects it has on our society as well as its environmental impact. Marketing on social media has negatively impacted fashion trends. The trends are constantly changing which causes over consumption and brands create over produced poor quality clothing. As a consequence of this, there is a negative impact on pollution as well as cheap labour.
 </p>
 <p>
   For my final website I took inspirations from fast fashion website such as H&M, Garage, Fashion Nova and Pretty little thing.
