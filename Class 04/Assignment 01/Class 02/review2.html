    <p> This is an interactive website on climate change that makes you choose 3 energy sources that will power the world by 2050. Like in the image below the 6 different energies are displayed in a carousel format. After you select one energy, <br>you get to play a mini game in which you collect particles. After you collect a certain amount of particles, information about the energy is displayed.  </p>
    <p>The website is very playful since you get to play a fun game while also learning more about the energies. The overall website is very colourful and unique and even the clicking of the buttons and selecting the energy is done in a playful way. <br> This website left an impact on me since the message behind is very important. Climate change is still a problem that our planet continues to struggle with and this allows us to learn more about the different energy sources we can use to help the planet.</p>
